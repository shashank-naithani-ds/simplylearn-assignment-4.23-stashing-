Stashing is like leaving you current work and saving that state, so that you can come later to work on it.

<b>Problem</b>
create a banch and edit a file that you inherited from master branch. Make a commit in that branch before you commit a second time, stash it away.

Switch to master branch and craete a new branch and apply the stash in that newly created branch. then
return to the first branch and apply the stash again, and the delete that stash entry.
